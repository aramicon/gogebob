add a change from laptop

here is a change

analogy is the motor of the car of thought

analogy though is not just "A is to B as C is to D" etc etc

It's more about common 'essence'

I am listening but not listening to Douglas Hofstadter talking about analogy. I cannot pay attention to two things at once.
